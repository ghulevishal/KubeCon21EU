Come to this session to learn about the Open Policy Agent (OPA) project. OPA is a general-purpose policy engine that solves a number of policy-related use cases for Kubernetes, microservices, CI/CD, cloud, and more. During this session the OPA maintainers will introduce the project for newcomers and then provide updates on the latest and greatest features landing in OPA and OPA Gatekeeper. If you are interested in policy and security as it relates to cloud native technology, this session is for you.
