Traditional web applications are still very popular among developers, and it is unlikely that this will change over the course of the next few years. Deploying these applications on top of Kubernetes is a challenge as they are not usually designed to be run in such environments. In this session, you will learn from Bitnamiâ€™s experience how best to make your traditional web application run on Kubernetes. Attend this session to see a step by step guide on how you can create a container image for a traditional application, build its configuration scripts, and run it on Kubernetes with a Helm template. We will also talk about some of the challenges you may face, such as supporting for scaling or automatic application updates, and ways to solve them.
