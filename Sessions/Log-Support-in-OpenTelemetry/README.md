OpenTelemetryâ€™s charter is to provide an observability framework for cloud-native software. Its goal is to provide full support for traces, metrics, and logs and provide a single implementation that can be leveraged. Traces have already reached a stable maturity level and metrics are well on their way. While logs were outside the GA scope of the project, they are an important data source and initial work has already kicked off to support them. - An initial data model has been accepted by the project - An initial implementation exists in the Java client library - Initial support has been added to the collector End users are interested in the plans for logs in OpenTelemetry. Will logging client libraries be introduced? Will native logging capabilities be added to the collector? How do context and resources work with logs? This session will dive into these topics to explain the current state and future direction. A demo of the current capabilities will be provided.
