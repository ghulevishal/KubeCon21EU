While Kubernetes can be challenging to newcomers, Kubernetes security overwhelms even the most seasoned professionals. It's a big challenge, so where should you even start? In this talk, Ellen and Tabitha will present an overview of concerns in Kubernetes security. And not only that: they’ll exploit issues along the way! Topics covered will include RBAC, admission control, and vulnerabilities in Kubernetes, Linux, your code, and underlying dependencies. You'll learn a mental framework, see its real-world impact, and leave with the knowledge you need to be able to “look it up, baby."
