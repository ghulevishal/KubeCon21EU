We will give an update on the status of the kubernetes/cloud-provider-aws and kubernetes-sigs/aws-load-balancer-controller repositories, and the roadmap for the future. We loosely divide the talk into 4 topics: 1. the migration from in-tree to out-of-tree (external) cloud-provider, 2. the ECR credential provider, 3. the future of the AWS cloud provider, including the work on the V2 provider, and 4. the current state and future of AWS load balancer controller. We welcome discussion and feedback during the talk.
