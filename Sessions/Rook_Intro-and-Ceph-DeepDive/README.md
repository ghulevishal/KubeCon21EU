The Rook project will be introduced to attendees of all levels and experience. Rook is an open source cloud-native storage operator for Kubernetes, providing the platform, framework, and support for a diverse set of storage solutions to natively integrate with Kubernetes. Rook turns storage software into self-managing and self-healing storage services. The benefits and use cases of Rook will be explored along with an overview of each of the Rook storage providers: Ceph, NFS, and Cassandra. A deep-dive will be presented for the Ceph storage provider on how Rook provides stable block, shared file system, and object storage for your production data. The recent features in the v1.6 release will be covered to further illustrate how Rook continues to be enhanced for production environments. Rook was accepted as a graduated project by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation in October 2020.
