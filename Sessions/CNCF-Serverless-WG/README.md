The Serverless WG will provide a short update on the CloudEvents project and then give an in-depth update on the current state and planned future work of the Serverless Workflow project. In this session we will explain the benefits of using workflows in your application architectures. You will learn the ins and outs of the Serverless Workflow project and its ecosystem, its tight integration with the CloudEvents specification for event-orchestration, as well as its design and deployment strategies on cloud/container platforms. In addition we will show examples and explain some of the more advanced workflow language concepts such as error handling, retries, compensation, event-correlation, and long-running workflows.
