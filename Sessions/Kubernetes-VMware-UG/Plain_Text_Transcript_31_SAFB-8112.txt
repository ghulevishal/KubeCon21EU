﻿Kubernetes VMware UG: What’s New for K8s Users on VMware Infrastructure - Steven Wong & Myles Gray, VMware: SAFB-8112 - events@cncf.io

Participant: wordly [W] English (US)

Hi. Welcome to the kubecon Europe session for the kubernetes, VMware user group. I'm Steve Wang co-chair of the group. I'm a software, engineer assigned to work on the kubernetes project. I'm joined today by Miles gray, but he's had some
Internet access issues during this recording but he helped with material and he'll be joining us on the day of the presentation for QA miles is based in Europe and he's an authority on the subject of storage. And kubernetes
We'll give a link to this deck at the end and will hang around for QA.
The plan for today is to start with some material on how deprecation of the entry cloud provider and the entry storage driver might impact you as a user.
By the way, it's possible, the answer will be that it won't impact you at all.
Then we'll move on to cover recent and planned feature, enhancements and changes.
Third will quickly go over a top 3 list of do's and don'ts when running kubernetes on VMware, infrastructure firehydrant,
We will wrap up with information on how to join the user group.
So we'll start with coverage of deprecation of Entry.
both cloud provider and storage Shriver and what it means.
The.
Expected time frame or should I say release frame for the entry removal is kubernetes. 1.24
If you Deploy kubernetes on vsphere recently, you probably used the out of tree provider and the CSI storage Shriver in this case.
The next few slides don't affect you, but please hang around because we have coverage of over other topics coming. Right up.
If you are affected, don't fret. The new stuff has a lot of valuable features feature. Enhancements of going up have been going on exclusively in the auditory components for over a year now.
So this shift to the new stuff is probably going to be a good experience.
Ultimately, even if there's a little work to do in the short term, by the way, if you're on a commercial distribution, please follow your Benders guidance regarding migration.
I'm covering this on a generic version that might apply. If you're using pure Upstream kubernetes by the it's possible that your vendor hetzner
has added features to support a migration and you'd be best advised to follow their advice.
If you're faced with a migration and important thing to note is you must first upgrade. The, you must upgrade the cloud provider and the storage driver, at the same time, cross coupling, and old version of one with a new version of another
Simply doesn't work.
Also, if you're unlucky enough to be hosting kubernetes on an old vsphere version or and or withhold Hardware, it might be the end of the road for this old stuff as sometimes happens in the it field.
Eventually things can get so old that it's time to replace them.
Here's a table comparing old and new features of the storage plugins entry and out of tree.
And you can see here that the CSI driver offers some really nice enhancements. Although, there are a few things that are not carried forward at this time, one probably won't be in the other is in roadmap, but at the current time
Raw block volume support is under internal tests and has it been released?
I'd like to tell you migration is easy but since this involves persistent storage, you never really want to rush in and take chances better to go into too much detail than too little and this is a subject too big to fit into this.
35 minute session. This is something.
I'll I'd expect.
We'll cover in detail, perhaps with some demos and a future. Full meeting of the user group where we have more time to work with those meetings last can last in a full hour. In the meantime, here's a link to the documentation
I'm about to cover upcoming changes in the kubernetes one point two, One release.
But as I record this, it is an actually out yet.
it's expected very soon. By the time this video recording is are though. 1.21 will be out but it's possible.
Something might have change if so Miles and I will be present during the session and we'll issue any needed.
corrections. I don't know about you, but I just
Can't wait for live conferences to return again. So we're not faced with something like this.
The first item is a speed Improvement when you provision persistent volumes, this is more likely to be apparent when you run large clusters where large means many kubernetes cluster, VMS or
Where you're running on, many esxi hosts.
Next is a deprecation warning on the disc format option, which is something that has only been supported in the entry storage provider. Anyway. So what you have here is a deprecated feature inside a deprecated driver,
Probably won't affect most people but I'm just letting you know.
Speaking of deprecation, I think there has been a prior talk.
There's been prior talk of this but now a formal deprecation.
notice is being issued indicating that versions of vsphere of prior to 6.7 you. Three will be dropping out of support in the future.
Also, reaching end of support. Window is VM hardware version, 15. If you're running your kubernetes nodes on something prior to that, it's time to move them to more, modern homes.
This one could be problematic for a few people.
Deprecation of support for a kubernetes cluster spanning multiple V centers, as being announced as of kubernetes 1.21. The workaround would be to move your kubernetes nodes
To a single vcenter.
These deprecation notices, follow the kubernetes deprecation policy, meaning, you're getting a little advanced. Notice now actual drop out of these features is not expected to trigger until the 1.2 for release, but don't wait
Old man to react to this advice.
Start your start your reactions to the deprecation notices now.
Here's a bug.
Fix related to the now.
Deprecated entry storage, plug-in it relates to clean up of orphaned volume attachments, and more details can be found at the link in this slide.
Next, where I'm going to move on to.
Let's see a known issue that is not resolved.
We're API calls, might cause an error.
you can read more your Apple Inc.
alright, next I'm moving on to the top three list now I promised it was a top three but fair warning as I composed the deck I cheated a little in one item is expanded into some items, a b and c so maybe you get
A bonus extra three items today.
Users often resort to slack when issues arise and based on the experience of miles and I these have been the most common root causes of problems. Watch out for these number one you haven't enabled
Uuid, this causes storage related problems.
Second most common use cause is you've got the user and password credentials wrong for your vcenter. Either. They don't work at all or they're pointing to an account with inadequate, permissions
Third most common is not running on vsphere 6.7 you three or later when you're using combinations. Of cloud. Provider or storage provider that require that version or later?
And if it isn't one of those three often when you want want to ask for help on slack, people will want to know what's in your log files, more information, always helps with problem resolution.
So here is where you go for the cloud. Provider, logs, top three item to a
Moving on here is item to be also, knowing where the logs live in this case, for the CSI storage driver.
First step is to get the pods that are running CSI components. These pods will have, will have multiple containers and you can use kubecon ol commands to go, grab those logs.
For the CSI, related components.
Finally this, I guess this isn't really logs, but for vsphere, here's a good first, place to look in the vsphere UI, the recent tasks section shows activity.
And if something went wrong, you'll typically get a clue.
Possibly leading you to a root cause popping out there in that recent tasks list.
Third and final item for the top 3 list, the new own issues list for this ESI driver could be that you're not the first person to encounter a problem.
Maybe, you're not even the second or third and it rated coverage on the known issues list.
This link shows you where to go for that and this thing is regularly updated.
So wrapping up, if you use kubernetes on VMware infrastructure, the user group is a great place to go to get help from Deb's and other experienced users.
For example, we recently had a great bring us your problems Workshop that really covered a lot of interesting topics and it led to a bunch of feature requests that got exposed directly to some of the dams
Are working on the infrastructure that supports kubernetes running on vsphere that session went the full hour and we still didn't get to every topic.
So if this sort of thing interests, you I'd strongly encourage you to join the group and join the groups meetings.
We have a meaning each month and the agenda is actually user-driven but tikv
Typically we present tutorials and best practices.
It's up to members to nominate presentations and discussion topics, including feature requests and miles. And I if we get enough advance notice, might go out and trying to recruit guest
For presentations, and then we actually got some pretty experienced users showing up on a recurring basis.
The user group was founded with a couple of user tekton leads. Bryceton, Shepherd and Djoser see who helped get the group started.
But we're always looking for more people. And we'd like, to grow this group with a really diverse set of worldwide users. The group is also running a slack Channel, which is a
Great place to ask questions.
The in my experience users often asked questions in the general-purpose kubernetes user Channel.
But if you know your question is vsphere of focused, I think you tend to get a little more expert focus by targeting the VMware users Channel. Instead the slack isn't a great
Placed even search for things and the activity level in that generic kubernetes user channel is so great. That in my experience, a lot of dams don't want to go even look in a channel that has 50 topics a day.
Yep, they are willing to invest a little time in policing, a more specific Focus channel.
So, once again, I strongly recommend that you join the group and join the slack Channel, come to the meetings.
Speaking of meetings, the next user group meeting will be gern. June 3rd, at least in the North American time zone.
You can go to the kubernetes community calendar, which has a link in this slide to get a conversion to your own local time zone, and add it to your calendar. You become a group member by joining the mailing
Just show him the link here.
And then finally, here's the link.
To the group's slack Channel.
Here is contact information for miles and I wear on GitHub.
We're also available in that slack Channel.
I just mentioned I've also got a deck link here and here's a recommended session that I believe is coming up right after this one and this is put on
The Sig storage group and here's a link to that session in the skid site.
Thank you.
And I hope to see you in a future meeting. At this point I'm going to turn it back over to the conference moderators and we'll move on to Q&A where Miles and I are going to stay on the air and a hangout for questions that you might have.
