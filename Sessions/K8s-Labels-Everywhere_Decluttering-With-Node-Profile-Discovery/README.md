A recent CNCF community survey showed that 57% of respondents have 100+ machines in their fleet and 17% have more than 5000 machines (including VM, bare metal etc.). When managing such broad and diverse clusters, variations in node capabilities and features are inevitable. So how exactly are individual features tracked on a node-by-node basis? Node Feature Discovery (NFD) is commonly used for basic feature discovery and labelling across a Kubernetes cluster. This talk, however, introduces a new component: Node Profile Discovery (NPD). NPD provides an extra layer of abstraction from NFD, alleviating the burden of managing individual features. NPD is designed to work in conjunction with NFD, aggregating individual features into higher level profiles and applying these profiles to suitable nodes. This talk will show how NPD can make life easier for application developers and sys-admins alike.
