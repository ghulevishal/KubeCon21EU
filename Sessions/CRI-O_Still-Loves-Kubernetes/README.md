In Kubernetes 1.20, support for the dockershim was deprecated, leaving many wondering what will take its place. Wonder no longer: CRI-O is a container runtime written exclusively for Kubernetes, and is ready to take the dockershim’s place. In addition to being a standard component for deploying secure and stable Kubernetes clusters, CRI-O has the unique advantage of being able to tailor its behavior to the needs of the Kubelet. In this talk, the maintainers of CRI-O will provide an update about the latest feature developments, as well as live demonstrating typical real world use cases around them. Join the CRI-O maintainers as they walk through the latest improvements in communication with the Kubelet under load, container stats reporting, user namespaces, and seccomp profile generation, as well as a general project update. After this session, you should know more about how CRI-O works in action and why it’s the perfect choice for your Kubernetes cluster!
