Existing networking APIs like Ingress and Service were designed in the very early days of Kubernetes. They got many things right, but it was quite difficult or even impossible to use those APIs for more advanced use cases. This resulted in a proliferation of implementation-specific annotations and custom resources that fragmented the user experience and have proven to be difficult to evolve. The Kubernetes networking SIG has been developing a new set of APIs that aim to solve these problems. The Gateway APIs project defines Kubernetes APIs to configure advanced concepts like traffic splitting, header matching, and load balancing configuration. In this talk, Harry and Rob will provide an overview of these APIs and some insight into the design decisions that have been made along the way. They will demo some of the advanced capabilities of these APIs, showcasing the portability of the APIs across implementations. Finally, they will provide a roadmap for the future of this project.
